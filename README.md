# vscode-config
Umang's Config/Settings for VS Code.

### What's the point of this repo?

I switch laptops and OSes a lot, and often find myself reconfiguring VS Code to my liking. It only makes sense to keep the confi stored at a place I can copy from any time I want, and people can use my config if they find it useful.

Note: Most of these are just visual tweaks.
